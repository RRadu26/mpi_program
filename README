Process 0 calculates this number, and like the other processes later, takes this number and determines how many of its processes will need to take
one more number. Process 0 sends the following to process 3: the number of numbers processed by each worker, the number of numbers to be sent 
(the ones processed by the current process are no longer sent), the actual numbers, and the number of workers that will need to process one more
number. Each process sends to the next process (0>3>2>1).

Each coordinator process will send the number of numbers and the actual numbers to be processed to the worker processes in its cluster,
and the worker processes will send them back processed. Finally, these processes are sent to 0. 1 sends to 2, 2 sends what it has and 
what it has received for 1 to 3, and 3 sends everything to process 0, which assembles and displays the result (if the error is 1), otherwise
1 sends the topology directly to 0. The same thing happens when sending topologies, if the error is 1, it is sent to 2 and so on, otherwise 1
sends the topology directly to 0.
